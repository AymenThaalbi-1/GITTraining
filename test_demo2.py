# Any pytest file should start with test_ or end with _test

# to follow pytest framework standards, whatever code you write, you have to write it in function
# pytest method names should start with test
# every method is treated as 1 test case

# method should be named carefully, so you can use regular expression (-k regex) to select the test cases
# you want to run.

# -s is used for logs in output
# -v is used from more info

# you can run specific file with py.test <filename>

# if you want to run a group of test cases (E.g. those marked for smoke test), you can mark (or tag or group) a set
# of test cases using the @pytest.mark.name_you_give

# to skip a test case, use a registered mark named skip. @pytest.mark.skip

# use @pytest.mark.xfail to execute a test case but not fail it.
# An xfail means that you expect a test to fail for some reason. A common example is a test for a feature not
# yet implemented, or a bug not yet fixed. When a test passes despite being expected to fail
# (marked with pytest.mark.xfail), itâ€™s an xpass and will be reported in the test summary.
